#How to run the app
Target API: 23 Android 6.0
Device: 4.7 WXGA
Partition size: 2gb
Dimensions: 1280 Width 720 Height

(Device used previously in class projects)

Also should run on most others such as the pixel
3a and Pixel 7 devices on newer APIs but for grading
purposes only fully intended and functionally
guaranteed for above device

This project is significantly more computationally intensive than previous projects. It runs fine on the emulators on my laptop if I make sure I don't have anything else open, so if it is buggy resources might need to be adjusted to run it well.
A really slow or bogged down device will change how the game presents itself, so it is important it be able to run well.

#Notes

Tried to add in as many comments as possible to improve clarity in GameActivity

If its hard to get any points due to using a mouse
you can try changing the game speed in GameActivity.java. It
is set at 100, which is pretty quick, but if you increase it up to 1000 it will slow how regularly the game updates

The themes are not intended to change colors throughout the app, only in the actual game
